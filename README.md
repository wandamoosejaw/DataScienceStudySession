# Data Science Study Session
This repository contains notebooks compiled from my study sessions following the Microsoft 'Data Science for Beginners' curriculum which you can view through this link: https://github.com/microsoft/Data-Science-For-Beginners.

My process involved not only completing the core activities but also actively experimenting with the code and adding extensive, line-by-line comments to solidify my understanding. This approach has allowed me to document my progress and demonstrate my ability to learn, adapt, and apply new technical skills in a data-driven environment.
