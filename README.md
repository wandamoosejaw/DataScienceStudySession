# Data Science Study Session
This repository contains notebooks compiled from my study sessions following the Microsoft 'Data Science for Beginners' curriculum which you can view through this link: https://github.com/microsoft/Data-Science-For-Beginners.

I have added my own experiments and detailed comments to each notebook to demonstrate my understanding of the concepts.
